3. Organize everything under one root folder, e.g. `FF_Dataset/`

### Celeb-DF v2 (Cross-Dataset Validation)
Used for cross-dataset generalization testing in the final project.
- Download from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/reubensuju/celeb-df-v2
- Place real videos in `Celeb_DF/real/` and fake videos in `Celeb_DF/fake/`

---

## Additional File Required

Download the dlib 68-point facial landmark predictor:
- Link: http://dlib.net/files/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2
- Extract and place `shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat` inside your `FF_Dataset/` folder

## Pretrained Models

Download all 4 pretrained models from Google Drive and place them inside your `FF_Dataset/` folder:

| Model File | Description | Download |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| `xception_model.h5` | Xception (primary deep learning model) | [Download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GOPA14OhYCVm40J0VV2oa1Jl3O5_FfKw/view?usp=sharing) |
| `efficientnet_model.h5` | EfficientNet-B0 with Spatial Attention | [Download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MVWjkzzfjYp2ek8dibgDfUXdJXW2r3Gd/view?usp=sharing) |
| `svm_model.pkl` | FFT + SVM baseline | [Download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GHKqGyTXiUJyFXV1LOQK0nUyvomYTou_/view?usp=sharing) |
| `rf_model.pkl` | dlib + Random Forest baseline | [Download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1H-1ciqhQRTtgLheivX31K25MlRWTz3mN/view?usp=sharing) |

## Setup

**1. Clone this repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ishal1410/deepfake-detection-faceforensics.git
cd deepfake-detection-faceforensics
```

**2. Download pretrained models:**  
Download all 4 models from the links above and place them in your `FF_Dataset/` folder.

**3. Open the notebook:**  
Open `deepfake_detection.ipynb` in VS Code or Jupyter Notebook

**4. Update the dataset path:**  
In **Cell 2**, change the path to match your local setup:
```python
DATASET_PATH = r"C:\your\path\to\FF_Dataset"
```

## How to Run

### Option 1 - Full Pipeline (Notebook)
Run all cells in `deepfake_detection.ipynb` from top to bottom. The notebook includes:
- Face extraction and alignment using MTCNN
- FFT + SVM baseline model
- dlib + Random Forest baseline model
- Xception deep learning model (two-stage fine-tuning)
- EfficientNet-B0 with Spatial Attention Module
- Equal Weighted Ensemble (0.5/0.5) — optimal weights found via sensitivity analysis
- Ensemble Weight Sensitivity Analysis
- Background Masking for aggressive face cropping
- Grad-CAM explainability (correct predictions + failed cases)
- Per-manipulation type analysis
- Cross-dataset validation on Celeb-DF v2
- Grad-CAM on Celeb-DF failed cases
- Real-time Grad-CAM video overlay

> **Smart Skip Logic:** Training cells automatically skip if a saved model already exists. To retrain, delete the corresponding file.

### Option 2 - Demo Script
After models are in place, run the demo on any video:
```bash
python demo.py
```
The demo uses the Equal Weighted Ensemble (0.5/0.5) to classify a video as **REAL** or **FAKE** with a confidence score.

## Results Summary

| Model | Accuracy | AUC |
|-------|----------|-----|
| FFT + SVM | 75.33% | 0.8124 |
| dlib + Random Forest | 76.74% | 0.8694 |
| Xception | 92.67% | 0.9881 |
| EfficientNet-B0 + Spatial Attention | 89.33% | 0.9611 |
| Equal Ensemble (0.5/0.5) | **95.33%** | **0.9767** |
| Celeb-DF Cross-Dataset | 75.00% | — |

## Updates & New Features (Final Submission)

### 1. Ensemble Optimization
- Updated from 0.6/0.4 to Equal Ensemble (0.5/0.5) — found optimal through sensitivity analysis
- Achieves best accuracy of 95.33% on FaceForensics++ test set

### 2. Ensemble Weight Sensitivity Analysis
- Tested 6 weight combinations from 0.3/0.7 to 0.8/0.2
- Generated comparison graph showing accuracy and AUC for each combination
- Confirmed 0.5/0.5 as optimal weighting

### 3. Background Masking
- Implemented elliptical background masking after MTCNN face extraction
- Removes background pixels — forces model to focus purely on facial boundary artifacts
- Visual comparison of original vs masked faces included

### 4. Cross-Dataset Validation on Celeb-DF v2
- Downloaded 10 real + 10 fake videos from Celeb-DF v2
- Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/reubensuju/celeb-df-v2
- Used domain-adapted threshold of 0.35 for higher quality fakes
- Achieved 75.00% accuracy — demonstrates generalization challenge

### 5. Extended Grad-CAM Analysis
- Added Grad-CAM on Celeb-DF failed cases
- Shows why model struggles with high-quality unseen fakes
- Reveals diffuse activation patterns vs focused artifact regions in FF++

### 6. Real-Time Grad-CAM Video Overlay
- Added live heatmap overlay directly on video frames
- Displays prediction label, confidence score, and Grad-CAM activation in real time
- Output videos saved for both real and fake samples
